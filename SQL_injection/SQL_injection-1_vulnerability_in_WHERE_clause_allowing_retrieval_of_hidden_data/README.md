# SQL injection - vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

## Difficulty - APPRENTICE

---

This lab contains a **SQL injection** vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:
```SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1```

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.
