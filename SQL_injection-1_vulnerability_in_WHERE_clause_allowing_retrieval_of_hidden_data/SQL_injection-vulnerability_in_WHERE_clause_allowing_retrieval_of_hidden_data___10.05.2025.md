## 🔍 Intercepting request 

> I intercept the request in the product category filter in BurpSuite:

> Need to force the application to display additional hidden products on the page.

> Testing SQL injection in the `category` parameter using a logical expression (Boolean-Based SQL injection):

```http

GET /filter?category=' or 1=1 -- HTTP/2

```

> **Result: display unreleased products**
![unreleased_product](./screenshots/unreleased_product.png)

> It's work.

> **Note** this works because `OR 1=1` always returns `true`; `--` symbol is used as a comment in SQL syntax. Anything after it is ignored.
> So it turns out that the logical expression with `or` in this case with `WHERE category = '' or 1=1` results in all rows from the `products` table being selected without filtering
> by category.

> **Result: solved lab**

## conclusion

> To protect against Boolean-Based SQL injection, you can use prepared statements. That is, instead of substituting data directly into the SQL string `"SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '" + user_input + "'"`
> use `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?", (user_input,))`. This way, user input is not interpreted as part of the SQL query.

> You also need to escape the quote characters - `' '` and `" "` (but it is better to use parameterization).
