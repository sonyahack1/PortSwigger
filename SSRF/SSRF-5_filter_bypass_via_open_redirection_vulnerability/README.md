# SSRF Lab - with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability

## Difficulty - APPRENTICE

---

> This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

> To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at
> `http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin` and delete the user `carlos`.

> The stock checker has been restricted to only access the local application, so you
> will need to find an open redirect affecting the application first.
