# SSRF Lab - SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

## Difficulty - PRACTITIONER

---

> This lab has a `stock check` feature which fetches data from an internal system.

> To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the `admin interface` at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the `user carlos`.

> The developer has deployed `two weak anti-SSRF defenses` that you will need to bypass.
